# Project Code: DA-02
1. Identify the independent and dependent attributes.
2. Characterize the independent attributes depending on three types of 
variables
 a. Nominal
 b. Categorical
 c. Continues
3. Perform below stated two non-parametric tests between each 
independent and dependent attribute and calculate p-values. 
 a. Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variable
 b. Chi-square test for nominal and categorical variable
4. Arrange the p values in ascending order.
5. Identify the three most significant independent attributes that have a 
high impact on dependent variable.
